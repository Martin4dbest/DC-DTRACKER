AWS Credentials Setup for Boto3
1. Ensure AWS Credentials Are Set Up Properly
AWS SDK (boto3) looks for credentials in specific locations. If you haven't configured your AWS credentials yet, you'll need to do so. You can set up AWS credentials using the following methods:

Using AWS CLI:
You can use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to configure your credentials.

Run the following command to set up your AWS access keys (if you haven’t already done so):

bash
Copy code
aws configure
This will prompt you to enter:

AWS Access Key ID
AWS Secret Access Key
Default region name (e.g., us-east-1)
Default output format (e.g., json)
Manually in the Environment Variables:
You can set your AWS credentials directly in your environment variables.

For Linux/macOS:
bash
Copy code
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your-access-key-id'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your-secret-access-key'
For Windows:
bash
Copy code
set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
AWS Credentials File:
You can also set up the credentials file manually at:

Linux/macOS: ~/.aws/credentials
Windows: C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.aws\credentials
Add the following contents:

ini
Copy code
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your-access-key-id
aws_secret_access_key = your-secret-access-key
Using IAM Roles (if running on AWS EC2):
If your application is running on an EC2 instance with an IAM role, make sure that the role has appropriate permissions to access SNS. AWS SDK will automatically use the credentials associated with that role.

2. Verify AWS SDK Configuration
After setting up the credentials, restart your application to ensure that the SDK recognizes the credentials.

3. Test Your Configuration
You can test if the credentials are being used correctly by running a simple boto3 script like this:

python
Copy code
import boto3

sns_client = boto3.client('sns')
response = sns_client.list_topics()
print(response)
If it returns a list of SNS topics (or an empty list if you don’t have any), then your credentials are set up correctly.

To Set Your AWS Credentials on Windows:
Here’s how you can set AWS credentials using environment variables on Windows.

Option 1: Set Environment Variables in Command Prompt (Temporary)
This method will set your AWS credentials for the current session of the Command Prompt. Once you close the Command Prompt window, the credentials will no longer be available.

Open Command Prompt:

Press Windows + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.
Set Environment Variables: In the Command Prompt window, use the following commands to set your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. Replace your-access-key-id and your-secret-access-key with your actual AWS credentials.

bash
Copy code
set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
Example:

bash
Copy code
set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Run Your Application: Now that the credentials are set, you can run your Python application from the same Command Prompt window, and boto3 should be able to locate and use the credentials.
